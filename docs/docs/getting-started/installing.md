# Installing & Upgrading Nexus

## ðŸ›  Installation

Make sure you're running a supported Minecraft server platform. We recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io) or any other forks of Paper.

You can download Nexus either from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/nexuss) for stable releases, or from the [actions page](https://github.com/BX-Team/Nexus/actions/workflows/build.yml) for development builds with the latest features and bug fixes.

Once you downloaded Nexus JAR, place it in the "plugins" folder on your Minecraft server. Make sure the file is located in the same directory as other plugins that are already installed.

After placing the JAR file in the plugin folder, restart the Minecraft server. Nexus should be automatically loaded by the server. If the plugin doesn't load correctly, inform us about it in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/BX-Team/Nexus/issues) or on our [discord](https://discord.gg/FQ7jmGBd6c)
